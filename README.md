# GitWorkshops
Welcome to our GitHub workshop. Get ready to learn all about the basics of using GitHub. Below are list of useful links and commands that we'll be using throughout this workshop.

Set Up
======
Begin by [downloading git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git Downloads")
And [create your GitHub account](https://github.com "GitHub Homepage")

Basic Linux Commands
======
These are the Linux commands that you'll be using in Git Bash (which you've just downloaded)

   `ls` shows files and folders (aka directories)  
   `mkdir <folder_name>` makes a new directory  
   `cd <directory_path>` changes directory to the specified path  
   `touch <file_name>` used to update access date of file/directory  
   `cp <file> <new_file>` copies contents of `<file>` to `<new_file>`  
   `mv <file> <new_file>` moves `<file>` and it's contents to another location/name  
   `rm [-rf] <file>` removes file (`-rf` tag removes folders and their contents, recursively)

### Forking
Forking is a **GitHub** feature that creates a copy of a repository in your account.  
1. One person will fork to their personal account by clicking the **"Fork"** button in the upper right hand corner.
2. Invite your teammates to join your forked repository by going to the **"Settings"** page of the repository.
